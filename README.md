# Neovim dependency check

## Prelude

The concept and the final result is totally copied from [vim-package-info](https://github.com/meain/vim-package-info),
but since that package wasn't working on my setup, and I really don't like debugging javascript on my free time, I rewrote it in Rust as an exercise.

Also a thank you goes to @srishanbhattarai and the repo https://github.com/srishanbhattarai/neovim-calculator for giving me the idea and the basics of how
to write a neovim plugin in Rust.

This is still a 2 days worth of work, so don't use it yet (it seems to work good on Cargo.toml files anyway)
